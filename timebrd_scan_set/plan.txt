* Open the flags file, find either the AUTOGENERATED_DATA indicator or if none then the last line in the file
* If there are any uncommented lines then comment them and save their information as the line to be editted and autogenerate-saved
* Clobber the autogenerated line/add a new autogenerated line (which is the previous uncommented one if there was one) with the settings chosen here editted (leave other settings the same)
* Close file
