  In this directory is the client/server used for scalers
  on the Left-arm which included the new SIS3801 scalers running
  in 3801 mode (i.e. with FIFO) and obtaining data from the
  "producer" which put data into shared memory like SIS1Cumulative
  etc in the SIS.h include file.

  Add one pair of client/server using TCP/IP protocol (buffcli.c and 
  buffser.c). These client/server is used to save the Buffer in order 
  to analyse it later.

  Another pair (badser.c and badcli.c) allows to spy on how much
  "bad" data are being taken by the 3801 scalers.  See code for
  definition of bad.

  Rather major change -- instead of using bdaInsertEvent (DD system)
  we use etInsertEvent (ET system).
  The old code was stored in ../hadron_DD
