The main contents of this software:
===================================

       Makefile       -- To compile, type "make"

       etInsertEvent.c  -- code to insert data into ET system
                         (not used for Compton DAQ at the moment)

       vxWscaler.h    -- header used by TCP/IP client/server
       scacli.c       -- TCP/IP client, runs on Linux 
       scaser.c       -- TCP/IP server, runs on VME cpu.


The client code scacli.c compiled into executible scread:
========================================================= 
    Usage:
 
         scread      -- simple print out of scalers data
         scread -x   -- hexidecimal printout
         scread -i   -- insert data into ET system (event type 140)
           (we'll need to adjust this for Compton if we care to use it)
         scread -h   -- "help" to show various options.

* new Sept 2009 *
         scread -p 5  -- print counts on 6th location of buffer (0=1st)
         scread -p 7 -r  -- print rate on 8th location.
                        (Rate is normalized to location #CLKCHAN)
