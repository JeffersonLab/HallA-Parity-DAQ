         xscaler and stripcharts for PVDIS
        ====================================

  under development -- needs some more work

I. XSCALER
===========

  To start type

        ./xscaler Left    

  or

        ./xscaler Right

  The scaler.map file also controls the names of the buttons,
  which needs some adjustment still.

  I'm normalizing all rates to the 103.8 kHz clock whose location
  is defined in the scaler.map file.  This means this channel
  will display 103.8 kHz (by definition).

  A strip tool is available : click on the button of a channel.
  Note, this does not update except when you click on the
  button.

  (An updating strip tool exists as well -- I will try to 

  revive it soon and report here.)

II. STRIP CHART
================

  The strip chart is a macro to show scalers and ratios of scalers.
  The data are obtained online directly from VME.
  You can invoke the strip chart software from the ROOT prompt 
  as follows

     root

     .x strip.C("Left") 
 or
     .x strip.C("Right")

  and don't forget the dot(.) before the x


III.  SCREAD   -- primitve text-based readings
=============

  For a primitive text-based reading, type

           ./screadL
  or
           ./screadR

  These display counts on L-HRS and R-HRS respo.

  To get rates type

           ./screadL -r
  or
           ./screadR -r

  Here the rate is (imprecisely) normalized to the 
  10 sec sleep time between reads.  In contrast, xscaler
  should be much more accurate on rates.
