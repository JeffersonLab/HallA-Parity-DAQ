   HANA SCALER PACKAGE
   ====================

Robert Michaels, Jefferson Lab

For documentation, see

http://hallaweb.jlab.org/equipment/daq/THaScaler.html

See also notes in the Makefile.

To use the THaScaler class, you should only need to look at
THaScaler.h (header) to see the public interface.  All the
methods you need should be there.  

Notes:

   1. Make sure you have the scaler map file in your directory.
      See 'scaler.map' in /hana_scaler directory or in $DB_DIR

   2. If you are running within the context of the analyzer,
      see THaScaler.html (link shown above).  It explains how
      to enable scalers and get the data into the output Tree.

   3. If you are running standalone codes, see comments in
      Makefile about the *main* routines.  Usually these are
      deployed in the adaq computers in the counting room.
