        1. scaler.map modifications.  
          a) Parsing of "DATE" is more intelligent.
          b) Can tie scalers of different helicities or crates together
             (fewer repititious lines in scaler.map file)
          c) New feature of "directives" (backward compatible since
             old code will ignore them).  Accomplishes 1b and 4 below.

        3. Obsoleted THaNormScaler and THaScalerBank classes
	   (simplifies the code).

        4) THaScalerGui (used by xscaler) driven by scaler.map
           but with sensible defaults of scaler.map absent.
