         xscaler for PVDIS
        ==================

  R. Michaels,  Sep 30, 2009

  under development


  To start type

        ./xscaler Left    

  or

        ./xscaler Right

  The scaler.map file also controls the names of the buttons,
  which needs some adjustment still.

  I'm normalizing all rates to the 103.8 kHz clock whose location
  is defined in the scaler.map file.  This means this channel
  will display 103.8 kHz (by definition).

  A strip tool is available : click on the button of a channel.
  Note, this does not update except when you click on the
  button.

  (An updating strip tool exists as well -- I will try to 
  revive it soon and report here.)
