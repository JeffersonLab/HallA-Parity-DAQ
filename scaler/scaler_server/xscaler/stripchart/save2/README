  Strip Chart for PVDIS Scalers
  =============================

  R. Michaels    Jan 2009

  This is still just a template.  Need to flesh it out more.

  The strip chart is a macro to show scalers and ratios of scalers.
  The data are obtained online directly from VME.
  You can invoke the strip chart software from the ROOT prompt 
  as follows

     root
     .x strip.C("Left") 
 or
     .x strip.C("Right")

  and don't forget the dot(.) before the x

  It is required to have the following shared object files
  which are part of the analyzer package.

     libdc.so
     libscaler.so

  One also needs the scaler.map file, as usual.
 
     scaler.map

  The macro is contained in these files (header and implementation):

     strip.h
     strip.C
