   Scheme to flush read PVDIS scalers online with or without CODA
   ===============================================================

   R. Michaels,  Sept 30, 2009

  The PVDIS scalers can be read with a primitive TCP/IP 
  client/server.  These are in  ~/devices/pvdis/onlineL and onlineR
  for the Left and Right HRS.

  Go there and type 

          ./scread              (this obtains counts)

  or 

          ./scread -r           (this obtains rates)

   In order to read the scalers in between runs, we wrote a 
   simple VME task called scaloop (in this directory).
   The object code is loaded and the task spawned in
   ~/vxworks/pvdiss1.boot  and pvdis2.boot for the R and L HRS.

   The way scaloop works:

       It looks at the flag coda_run_flag which is set in
   the CRL routine.  If coda_run_flag==1 then CODA is running
   and the scaler FIFOs are flushed and put into global memory.
   If coda_run_flag==0 then scaloop does this flushing instead.
   It is important that scaloop does NOT flush when CODA is
   running.  This could ruin our data !  
        You can tell its working because at the VME prompt,
   every 20 sec you'll see a friendly printout which is either

     -> scaloop: local flush of FIFO (its ok) 

   or

     -> scaloop: FIFO flush by CODA (its ok)

   The former is when coda_run_flag==0.


Appendix about xscaler

  Further, the scalers can be read by "xscaler" (still under
  development):  cd ~apar/scaler/xscaler and see the README
  file there.  Basically

           ./xscaler Left  

   or

           ./xscaler Right

   and the GUI is controlled by scaler.map.
