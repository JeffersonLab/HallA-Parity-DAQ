Parity DAQ in Hall A

This is for the software for the Hall A Parity DAQ. 

Cameron Clarke turned the directory ~apar/devices into a github repository
in August 2018.

Sept 2018
Bob Michaels made a tarfile of the old directories, then either deleted or moved
them to another place.  E.g. ~/caen767/.  Only stuff remains that is part of the
Parity DAQ.   
  Also, Bob looked at differences to ~/caryn/devices and pulled all her changes over,
then commited them here.  We would prefer to use "git" in the future.  Make a branch
and/or make a "forked" copy of the repository and make "pull" requests.

 In March 2015, this software was imported to Bob Michaels github repository
from CVS.  Prior to 2015 the software had been maintained in CVS at JLab.
